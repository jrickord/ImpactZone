Addressed missing data, manipulated existing data to address data quality concerns, leveraged visual, correlatory-based, as well as ANOVA-based methods of feature selection, and proceeded to leverage simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, lasso and ridge regression techniques to identify populations most vulnerable to COVID-19 Infections
